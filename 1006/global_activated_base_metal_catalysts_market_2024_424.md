<h1>Global Activated Base Metal Catalysts Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>activated base metal catalysts market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 2.34 billion in 2024 to USD 3.45 billion by 2030</strong>, registering a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.7%</strong>, according to a comprehensive new market analysis. This growth trajectory reflects expanding applications across petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and industrial chemical sectors, where catalytic efficiency and process optimization remain paramount.</p><p>Activated base metal catalysts (ABMCs) â heterogeneous catalysts primarily composed of nickel, cobalt, or copper â have become indispensable for their <strong>cost-effectiveness, high reactivity, and adaptability</strong> in hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and hydration reactions. Their ability to operate under moderate temperatures while maintaining selectivity positions them as preferred alternatives to precious metal catalysts in bulk chemical production.</p><p><strong>1. Petrochemical Industry Expansion:</strong><br>
The petrochemical sector, accounting for <strong>45% of total catalyst demand</strong>, continues to drive adoption. Recent capacity additions in Asia-Pacific and Middle East refining complexes have accelerated consumption, with nickel-based catalysts demonstrating particularly strong growth at <strong>7.5% annually</strong> due to their effectiveness in desulfurization processes.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
