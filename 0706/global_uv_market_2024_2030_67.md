<h1>Global UV-360 Market Research Report 2024-2030(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>UV-360 market</strong> is projected to experience significant growth from <strong>2024 to 2030</strong>, driven by increasing demand for high-performance ultraviolet stabilizers across multiple industries. UV-360 (CAS:103597-45-1), a benzotriazole-based UV absorber, has become indispensable in polymer stabilization applications due to its exceptional light stability and compatibility with various resins.</p><p><strong>1. Expanding Polymer Demand in Construction and Automotive:</strong><br>
The growing construction sector's demand for durable, weather-resistant materials is pushing adoption of UV stabilizers like UV-360. In automotive applications, the shift toward lightweight plastic components to improve fuel efficiency has created additional demand, with <strong>automotive plastics consumption</strong> growing at approximately <strong>5.8% annually</strong>.</p><p><strong>2. Stringent Material Performance Standards:</strong><br>
Regulatory pressures across North America and Europe are forcing manufacturers to adopt higher-grade stabilizers. The European REACH regulations and U.S. FDA compliance requirements have particularly driven demand for high-purity UV stabilizers in food-contact applications.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
