<h1>Decaborane Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2031</h1><p>The global <strong>Decaborane market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>$3.8 million in 2024 to $4.7 million by 2031</strong>, expanding at a steady <strong>CAGR of 3.3%</strong> during the forecast period. This growth reflects rising adoption across semiconductor manufacturing, medical therapies, and advanced materials science, though market expansion remains constrained by complex production processes and niche applications.</p><p>Decaborane (B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>) - a high-energy boron compound - continues to demonstrate unique value in <strong>Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)</strong> for semiconductor doping, <strong>Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT)</strong> for cancer treatment, and as a precursor for boron nitride nanomaterials. Its remarkable thermal stability and boron content make it indispensable for specialized industrial and research applications where conventional boron sources prove inadequate.</p><p>The ongoing miniaturization of semiconductor devices has increased demand for precision boron doping agents, with decaborane proving superior to alternatives in creating <strong>ultra-shallow junctions below 20nm</strong>. Leading foundries now utilize decaborane-based processes for 30% of advanced node production, driving consistent demand growth.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
